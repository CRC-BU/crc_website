CRC Website
===========

This project houses files for the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative website (cogrhythms.bu.edu).

The current site is vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS, originally drafted in (*gasp*) Dreamweaver. It needs a facelift. It needs some content added and updated (especially from the 2013 conference). It needs to be easier for non-HTML people to maintain and augment.

So we're planning to move the site to GitHub and use some of the integrated templating features of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to simplify the life of the site. We also want to make better use of GitHub for working groups and collaborations, so will be moving that content here and making as much of it public as we can.

A note about [GitHub pages](pages.github.com): For project pages, whatever you put on the specially named `gh-pages` branch goes up as the site `username.github.io/projectname`. We'll handle domain renaming separately once we get this set up like we want it.

Another note: I'm putting up a superset of what's actually in use online now. Some of it is old, some is new, some is from abandoned "development branches" before I learned of the goodness that is git. All of it may be useful, so I'm throwing it in for now.
