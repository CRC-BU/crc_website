CRC Website
===========

This project houses files for the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative website (cogrhythms.bu.edu).

The current site is vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS, originally drafted in (*gasp*) Dreamweaver. It needs a facelift. It needs some content added and updated (especially from the 2013 conference). It needs to be easier for non-HTML people to maintain and augment.

So we're planning to move the site to GitHub and use some of the integrated templating features of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to simplify the life of the site. We also want to make better use of GitHub for working groups and collaborations, so will be moving that content here and making as much of it public as we can.
