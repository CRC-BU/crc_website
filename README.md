CRC Website
===========

This project houses files for the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative website (cogrhythms.bu.edu).

The site is now hosted by [GitHub pages](pages.github.com) at [http://cogrhythms.github.io/crc_website/](http://cogrhythms.github.io/crc_website/), with the more commonly used alias [cogrhythms.bu.edu](http://cogrhythms.bu.edu).  GitHub pages can use the templating features of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to simplify working with the site. We are also starting to make better use of GitHub for working groups and collaborations, and will be moving that content here and making as much of it public as we can.

A note about [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com): For project pages, whatever you put on the specially named `gh-pages` branch goes up as the site [http://cogrhythms.github.io/crc_website/](http://cogrhythms.github.io/crc_website/). ~~We'll handle domain renaming separately once we get this set up like we want it.~~

Here's Erik's list of things that still need fixing on this site:
* We should probably move lists of data to files in the `_data` directory. More info on how to work with those can be found at [jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/).
* Need accordian on faculty page.
